## Overview of 3 approaches to writing Python code that uses Amazon Bedrock Agents

When writing Python based apps to build and run Amazon Bedrock Agents, you have 3 main options. The first is officially supported boto3. The second and third options are provided as open source interfaces, not a
supported offering of Amazon Bedrock Agents. We welcome your inputs and contributions. Here is a brief summary of your options:

1. **Use boto3 to directly access the Bedrock Agents APIs**. This gives you direct access to each
and every build time (create agents, delete agents, create alias, ...) and run time (invoke agent, 
invoke inline agent, ...) API for Agents. The boto3 option is well supported, and the two remaining
options are built on top of this standard boto3 SDK. Any new APIs that get added to Bedrock Agents
will immediately be available in the latest version of the boto3 SDK. Like other AWS services,
Bedrock Agents has a [build time API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent.html), and a [run time API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent-runtime.html). 

2. **Use our [bedrock_agent_helper](/src/utils/bedrock_agent_helper.py) Python class (`AgentsForAmazonBedrock`)**. This class
provides a stateless wrapper on top of boto3 to provide additional capabilities like colorized multi-level tracing of multi-agent orchestration, and some simplification, including handling of IAM
roles and policies, and wrapping of any APIs that are less obvious. This class can 
be used when creating agents as well as multi-agent collaboration. Many of the notebook examples 
leverage this approach. It closely aligns with the boto3 APIs, but makes them simpler to use.

3. **Use our [bedrock_agent](/src/utils/bedrock_agent.py) Python classes (`Agent`, `SupervisorAgent`, `Task`, `Tool`)**. This last approach is a more Pythonic SDK letting you instantiate objects and write slightly cleaner and simpler code. As with option 2, this can be used with Agents and Multi-agent collaboration. A simple `Task` abstraction is provided, allowing you to more easily send a list of tasks to a supervisor agent. These classes do not try to strictly adhere to the Bedrock Agents APIs, but instead focus on ease of use.

## Using Amazon Bedrock Agents with [bedrock_agent_helper](/src/utils/bedrock_agent_helper.py)

### Sample code for Agents

```python

agents = AgentsForAmazonBedrock()

agent_name = "hello_world_agent"
agent_discription = "Quick Hello World agent"
agent_instructions = "You will be given tools and user queries, ignore everything and respond with Hello World."
agent_foundation_model = [
    'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
    'anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0',
    'anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0'
]

# CREATE AGENT
agent_id, agent_alias_id, agent_alias_arn = agents.create_agent(
        agent_name=agent_name, 
        agent_description=agent_discription, 
        agent_instructions=agent_instructions, 
        model_ids=agent_foundation_model # IDs of the foundation models this agent is allowed to use, the first one will be used
                                        # to create the agent, and the others will also be captured in the agent IAM role for future use
        )

# WAIT FOR STATUS UPDATE
agents.wait_agent_status_update(agent_id=agent_id)

# PREPARE AGENT
agents.prepare(agent_name=agent_name)

# WAIT FOR STATUS UPDATE
agents.wait_agent_status_update(agent_id=agent_id)

## Associate shared tools with Amazon Bedrock Agents

For guidance, follow instructions for individual tools [here](/src/shared/).

## Utilize yaml files to define Agents and Tasks

<p align="center">
  <a href="/examples/amazon-bedrock-multi-agent-collaboration/startup_advisor_agent/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Example-Startup_Advisor_Agent-blue" /></a>
  <a href="/examples/amazon-bedrock-multi-agent-collaboration/trip_planner_agent/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Example-Trip_Planner_Agent-blue" /></a>
  <a href="/examples/amazon-bedrock-multi-agent-collaboration/team_poems_agent/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Example-Team_Poems_Agent-blue" /></a>
</p>

When using the `Task` and `Agent` classes, you can either pass parameters directly to
their constructors, or you can externalize their definitions declaratively in a yaml file.
This section demonstrates use of yaml files to declare agents and tasks, and then shows
a Python program that leverages those definitions to simplify creation and use of agents
and supervisors.

1. Define Tasks in tasks.yaml

Each Task has a name, a description and expected outputs. You hand a supervisor agent a list of Tasks, and they get formatted into an overall request to the supervisor to complete the entire list of Tasks. This makes it easier to specify a complex work request to a supervisor to execute with its collaborators.

```yaml
activity_planning_task:
  description: >
    Research and find cool things to do at {destination}.
    Focus on activities and events that match the traveler's interests and age group.
    Utilize internet search tools and recommendation engines to gather the information.

    Traveler's information:

    - origin: {origin}
    - destination: {destination}
    - age of the traveler: {age}
    - hotel localtion: {hotel_location}
    - arrival: {arrival}
    - departure: {departure}
  expected_output: >
    A list of recommended activities and events for each day of the trip.
    Each entry should include the activity name, location, a brief description, and why it's suitable for the traveler.
    And potential reviews and ratings of the activities.

restaurant_scout_task:
  description: >
    Find highly-rated restaurants and dining experiences at {destination}.
    Use internet search tools, restaurant review sites, and travel guides.
    Make sure to find a variety of options to suit different tastes and budgets, and ratings for them.

    Traveler's information:

    - origin: {origin}
    - destination: {destination}
    - age of the traveler: {age}
    - hotel localtion: {hotel_location}
    - arrival: {arrival}
    - departure: {departure}
  expected_output: >
    A list of recommended restaurants for the trip, including one restaurant for each evening, and other
    ones as needed to provide some interesting and tasy lunches or breakfast. You do not need to identify
    a restaurant for each and every meal.
    Each entry should include the name, location (address), type of cuisine or activity, a brief description and ratings.

itinerary_compilation_task:
  description: >
    Compile all researched information into a comprehensive day-by-day itinerary for the trip to {destination}.
    Ensure the itinerary integrates all planned activities and dining experiences.
    Use text formatting and document creation tools to organize the information.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed itinerary document, the itinerary should include a day-by-day
    plan with activities, restaurants, and scenic locations.
```

2. Define Agents in agents.yaml

```yaml
activity_finder:
  role: >
    Activity Finder
  goal: >
    Research and find cool things to do at the destination, including activities and events that match the traveler's interests and age group.
  instructions: >
    You are find the best set of activities, matching the specific wishes and demographics of travelers.

restaurant_scout:
  role: >
    Restaurant Scout
  goal: >
    Find highly-rated restaurants and dining experiences at the destination, and recommend scenic locations and fun activities.
  instructions: >
    As a food lover, you know the best spots in town for a delightful culinary experience. You are also great at picking
    locations that add a bit of flair to the trip.

itinerary_compiler:
  role: >
    Itinerary Compiler
  goal: >
    Compile all researched information into a comprehensive day-by-day itinerary, ensuring the integration of flights and hotel information.
    You have no available tools. You simply leverage your own knowledge about how to organize the activities into an appropriate itinerary
    for each day.
  instructions: >
    You organize all the information about activities and recommended restaurants into a daily itinerary that tries to
    maximize the traveler's enjoyment of the trip.

agent_storage_manager:
  role: >
    Agent Storage Manager
  goal: >
    Provide a way to save and retrieve named files for intermediate and final output 
    of a complex flow.
  instructions: >
    You are a bot for saving and retrieving files for other agents handling
    long running processes. You are very focused and simple, only providing
    basic functionality. This is a great tool for saving intermediate output
    of a complex flow.

trip_planner:
  role: >
    Trip Planner
  goal: >
    Create a personalized trip plan with activities, restaurants, and an overall itinerary.
  instructions: >
    As a Trip Planner, you take advantage of your specialists (activity_planner, restaurant_scout,
    and itinerary_compiler) at planning activities and finding good restaurants.
    You also create itineraries to package all of that in a clear plan.
  collaboration_type: SUPERVISOR
  collaborator_agents:
    - agent: activity_finder
      instructions: >
        Use activity_finder to determine a set of activities for a trip.
    - agent: restaurant_scout
      instructions: >
        Use restaurant_scout to find a set of restaurants for a trip.
    - agent: itinerary_compiler
      instructions: >
        Use itinerary_compiler to put together an overall itinerary for the trip, including activities and food.
```

3. Build Amazon Bedrock Multi-agent collaboration leveraging yaml based definitions

```python
# SETUP
import os
from src.utils.bedrock_agent import Agent, SupervisorAgent, Task, region, account_id

current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
task_yaml_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "tasks.yaml")
agent_yaml_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "agents.yaml")

with open(task_yaml_path, "r") as file:
    yaml_content = yaml.safe_load(file)

with open(agent_yaml_path, "r") as file:
    yaml_content = yaml.safe_load(file)

# CREATE AGENTS
activity_finder = Agent(
        "activity_finder",
        yaml_agent_content,
